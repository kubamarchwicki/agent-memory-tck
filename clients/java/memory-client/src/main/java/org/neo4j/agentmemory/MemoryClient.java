/**
 * Provides asynchronous operations on hosted agent memory.
 *
 * <p>Implementations return domain values and live handles. Every returned
 * {@link Conversation} and {@link ReasoningStep}, including steps inside
 * traces and explanations, is bound to the client that produced it.
 * Handle operations use that client and the handle's stored identity.
 *
 * <p>Returned collections are immutable snapshots that preserve service
 * order. A live handle's detail fields describe the response that created
 * it; fetch the handle again to observe later changes to those fields.
 * Successful writes do not establish that extraction or enrichment is ready.
 *
 * <p>Remote failures complete the returned future exceptionally. Local
 * validation can throw before a future is returned, as documented by each
 * method. Implementations must preserve the documented validation timing,
 * result ordering, snapshot semantics, and client-owned failure contract.
 * The HTTP adapters use {@link MemoryServiceException} for a
 * non-success HTTP response, {@link ResponseDecodingException} for an
 * invalid success payload, and {@link MemoryClientException} for encoding
 * or transport failures.
 *
 * <p>Writes are not retried automatically. Cancelling a future does not
 * confirm transport cancellation. The {@code await} helpers bound the
 * caller's wait without cancelling or completing the supplied future.
 *
 * <p>Authentication requires a Workspace API key bound to the target workspace.
 * Admin keys with an explicitly supplied workspace ID are not yet supported.
 *
 * <p>The static {@code create} methods use the configured HTTP client,
 * or a new default JDK HTTP client when none is configured.
 * Another adapter can implement this interface and bind the same live
 * handle classes to itself.
